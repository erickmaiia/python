Welcome to my Python learning repository! Here, I document my journey of learning the Python programming language, covering various topics including basic structures, repetition loops, control structures, and more.

## What You'll Find in This Repository:

- **Basic Python Concepts:** Explore examples of fundamental Python concepts, such as variable declaration, data types, operators, and basic functions.

- **Repetition Loops:** Learn how to use repetition loops in Python, including `for` loops, `while` loops, and nested loops, to perform repetitive tasks efficiently.

- **Control Structures:** Discover the different control structures available in Python, such as `if` statements, `else` statements, `elif` statements, and `try-except` blocks, and how to use them to control the flow of your code.

- **Introduction to Python Libraries:** As you progress in your Python learning journey, you'll find examples and exercises related to popular Python libraries such as NumPy, pandas, and matplotlib, which are widely used for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.
